/** @ingroup core
Control rate setting.
Mozzi's CONTROL_RATE sets how many times per second updateControl() is called.
It can be any power of 2 greater than 64, and the largest value where it starts
to become impractical is around 1024. 64, 128, 256 and sometimes 512 are all
usable values. Try to keep it as low as you can, for efficiency, though higher
rates can sometimes give smoother results, avoiding the need to interpolate
sensitive variables at audio rate in updateAudio(). CONTROL_RATE has a default
of 64 Hz, but it can be changed at the top of your sketch, after the \#includes,
for example: \#define CONTROL_RATE 256
*/
#define CONTROL_RATE 64



/** @ingroup core
Used to set AUDIO_MODE to STANDARD, STANDARD_PLUS, or HIFI.

STANDARD / STANDARD_PLUS
---------------
Use \#define AUDIO_MODE STANDARD_PLUS in Mozzi/config.h to select this
output configuration, which is nearly 9 bit sound (-244 to 243) at 16384 Hz sample rate (AUDIO_RATE) and
32768 Hz PWM rate. It uses Timer 1 to for PWM and the sample updating routine (as an interrupt).

STANDARD is obsolete now, replaced by STANDARD_PLUS which is the default audio mode.
STANDARD mode uses 16384 Hz PWM rate with an output interrupt at the same frequency.  
Some people can hear the PWM carrier frequency as an annoying whine.

STANDARD_PLUS mode uses 32768 Hz PWM rate, so the PWM carrier is out of hearing range.
In this mode every alternate interrupt is used for the sample update (unless you /#define AUDIO_RATE 32768 in mozzi_config.h),
which makes it slightly less efficient than STANDARD, but almost always better.

Advantages: Only uses one timer for audio, and one output pin.
Disadvantages: low dynamic range.

Below is a list of the Digital Pins used by Mozzi for STANDARD and STANDARD_PLUS audio out on different boards.
Those which have been tested and reported to work have an x.
Feedback about others is welcome.

On Teensy 3.1 STANDARD and STANDARD_PLUS are the same, providing 16384Hz sample rate and 12 bit resolution on pin A14/ADC.
The Teensy 3.1 DAC output does not rely on PWM.


HIFI (not for Teensy 3.1)
----
Use \#define AUDIO_MODE HIFI in Mozzi/config.h to set the audio mode to HIFI for output 14 bit sound at 16384 Hz sample rate and 125kHz PWM rate.
The high PWM rate of HIFI mode places the carrier frequency beyond audible range, 
overcoming one of the disadvantages of STANDARD_PLUS mode.

Also, 14 bits of dynamic range in HIFI mode provides more definition than the nearly 9 bits in STANDARD_PLUS mode.
HIFI mode takes about the same amount of processing time as STANDARD_PLUS mode, and sounds clearer and brighter.
However, it requires an extra timer to be used on the Arduino, which could increase the chances of 
conflicts with other libraries or processes if they rely on Timer 2.

Timer 1 is used to provide the PWM output at 125kHz.
Timer 2 generates an interrupt at AUDIO_RATE 16384 Hz, which sets the Timer1 PWM levels.
HIFI mode uses 2 output pins, and sums their outputs with resistors, so is slightly less convenient for 
rapid prototyping where you could listen to STANDARD_PLUS mode by connecting the single output pin 
directly to a speaker or audio input (though a resistor of about 100 ohms is recommended).

The resistors needed for HIFI output are 3.9k and 499k, with 0.5% or better tolerance.
If you can only get 1% resistors, use a multimeter to find the most accurate. 
Use two 1M resistors in parallel if you can't find 499k.

On 328 based Arduino boards, output is on Timer1, with the high byte on Pin 9 and low byte on Pin 10.
Add the signals through a 3.9k resistor on high byte pin (9) and 499k resistor on low byte pin (10).
Also, a 4.7nF capacitor is recommended between the summing junction of the resistors and ground.

This dual PWM technique is discussed on http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/pwm-dac/dual-pwm-circuits/
Also, there are higher quality output circuits are on the site.

Advantages: higher quality sound than STANDARD_PLUS mode.  Doesn't need a notch filter on 
the audio signal because the carrier frequency is out of hearing range.

Disadvantages: requires 2 pins, 2 resistors and a capacitor, so it's not so quick to set up compared 
to a rough, direct single-pin output in STANDARD_PLUS mode.
 
Pins and where to put the resistors on various boards for HIFI mode.  
Boards tested in HIFI mode have an x, though most of these have been tested in STANDARD_PLUS mode
and there's no reason for them not to work in HIFI (unless the pin number is wrong or something).
Any reports are welcome. \n

/** @ingroup core
Sets up the timers for audio and control rate processes, storing the timer
registers so they can be restored when Mozzi stops. startMozzi() goes in your sketch's
setup() routine.

In STANDARD_PLUS and HIFI modes, Mozzi uses Timer 0 for control interrupts, disabling Arduino
delay(), millis(), micros() and delayMicroseconds(). 
For delaying events, you can use Mozzi's EventDelay() unit instead (not to be confused with AudioDelay()). 

In STANDARD mode, startMozzi() starts Timer 1 for PWM output and audio output interrupts,
and in STANDARD_PLUS and HIFI modes, Mozzi uses Timer 1 for PWM and Timer2 for audio interrupts. 

The audio rate defaults to 16384 Hz, but you can experiment with 32768 Hz by changing AUDIO_RATE in mozzi_config.h.

@param control_rate_hz Sets how often updateControl() is called.  It must be a power of 2.
If no parameter is provided, control_rate_hz is set to CONTROL_RATE,
which has a default value of 64 (you can re-\#define it in your sketch). 
The practical upper limit for control rate depends on how busy the processor is,
and you might need to do some tests to find the best setting.

@note startMozzi calls setupMozziADC(), which calls setupFastAnalogRead() and adcDisconnectAllDigitalIns(), 
which disables digital inputs on all analog input pins.  All in mozzi_analog.h and easy to change if you need to (hack).
They are all called automatically and hidden away because it keeps things simple for a STANDARD_PLUS set up, 
but if it turns out to be confusing, they might need to become visible again.

Stops audio and control interrupts and restores the timers to the values they
had before Mozzi was started. This will enable the standard Arduino time
functions millis(), micros(), delay(), and delayMicroseconds(). This could be
useful when using sensor libraries which depend on the same timers as Mozzi. 

A potentially better option for resolving timer conflicts involves using
non-blocking methods, such as demonstrated by the twowire_nonblock code in the
forked version of Mozzi on github, so sound production can continue while
reading sensors.

As it is, pauseMozzi restores all the Timers used by Mozzi to their previous
settings. Another scenario which could be easily hacked in MozziGuts.cpp could
involve individually saving and restoring particular Timer registers depending
on which one(s) are required for other tasks, so for example the control
interrupt (Timer 0) could be suspended while audio continues.*/
